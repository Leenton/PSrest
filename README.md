# PSrest

PSrest is a PowerShell module that provides a RESTful HTTP endpoint for executing PowerShell commands and scripts. The module allows you to expose PowerShell functionality as a web service, making it easy to integrate PowerShell with other applications and services.


## Reasons why events and procsses tab where dropped:

The additional development time and effort needed to bring these features to
fruition were too large to be handled in the intial release of PSRest without
significantly increasing the planned development time for this project.

A slimer less feature rich version of this project is inline with the original
problem statement this project was aiming to resolve. If the GUI features removed
are paramount for your usecase, this project is not ideal for your usecase, and
I recomend swithing to Powershell Universal by IronMan Software which offers a far
richer GUI and more mature platform for taking this type of problem.
