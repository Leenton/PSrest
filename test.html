NAME
    Write-Host
    
SYNOPSIS
    Writes customized output to a host.
    
    
SYNTAX
    Write-Host [[-Object] <System.Object>] [-BackgroundColor {Black | DarkBlue | DarkGreen | DarkCyan | DarkRed | DarkMagenta | DarkYellow | Gray | DarkGray | Blue | Green | Cyan | Red | Magenta | Yellow | White}] [-ForegroundColor {Black | DarkBlue | DarkGreen | DarkCyan | DarkRed | DarkMagenta | DarkYellow | Gray | DarkGray | Blue | Green | Cyan | Red | Magenta | Yellow | White}] [-NoNewline] [-Separator <System.Object>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    The `Write-Host` cmdlet's primary purpose is to produce for-(host)-display-only output, such as printing colored text like when prompting the user for input in conjunction with Read-Host (Read-Host.md). `Write-Host` uses the ToString() (/dotnet/api/system.object.tostring)method to write the output. By contrast, to output data to the pipeline, use Write-Output (Write-Output.md)or implicit output.
    
    You can specify the color of text by using the `ForegroundColor` parameter, and you can specify the background color by using the `BackgroundColor` parameter. The Separator parameter lets you specify a string to use to separate displayed objects. The particular result depends on the program that is hosting PowerShell.
    
    > [!NOTE] > Starting in Windows PowerShell 5.0, `Write-Host` is a wrapper for `Write-Information` This allows > you to use `Write-Host` to emit output to the information stream. This enables the capture or > suppression of data written using `Write-Host` while preserving backwards compatibility. > > The `$InformationPreference` preference variable and `InformationAction` common parameter do not > affect `Write-Host` messages. The exception to this rule is `-InformationAction Ignore`, which > effectively suppresses `Write-Host` output. (see "Example 5")

    <CommonParameters>
        This cmdlet supports the common parameters: Verbose, Debug,
        ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, WarningAction, WarningVariable,
        OutBuffer, PipelineVariable, and OutVariable. For more information, see
        about_CommonParameters (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216). 
    
INPUTS
    System.Object
        You can pipe objects to be written to the host to this cmdlet.
    
    
OUTPUTS
    None
        This cmdlet returns no output. It sends the objects to the host. The host displays the objects this cmdlet sends to it.
    
    
NOTES
    
    
        - When writing a collection to the host, elements of the collection are printed on the same line   separated by a single space. This can be overridden with the Separator parameter.
        
        - Non-primitive data types such as objects with properties can cause unexpected results and not   provide meaningful output. For example, `Write-Host @{a = 1; b = 2}` will print   `System.Collections.DictionaryEntry System.Collections.DictionaryEntry` to the host.
    
    -- Example 1: Write to the console without adding a new line --
    
    Write-Host "no newline test " -NoNewline
    Write-Host "second string"
    
    no newline test second string
    
    This command displays the string 'no newline test' with the `NoNewline` parameter.
    
    A second string is written, but it ends up on the same line as the first due to the absence of a newline separating the strings.
    --- Example 2: Write to the console and include a separator ---
    
    Write-Host (2,4,6,8,10,12) -Separator ", +2= "
    
    2, +2= 4, +2= 6, +2= 8, +2= 10, +2= 12
    
    This command displays the even numbers from two through twelve. The Separator parameter is used to add the string `, +2= ` (comma, space, `+`, `2`, `=`, space).
    -- Example 3: Write with different text and background colors --
    
    Write-Host (2,4,6,8,10,12) -Separator ", -> " -ForegroundColor DarkGreen -BackgroundColor White
    
    2, -> 4, -> 6, -> 8, -> 10, -> 12
    
    This command displays the even numbers from two through twelve. It uses the `ForegroundColor` parameter to output dark green text and the `BackgroundColor` parameter to display a white background.
    -- Example 4: Write with different text and background colors --
    
    Write-Host "Red on white text." -ForegroundColor red -BackgroundColor white
    
    Red on white text.
    
    This command displays the string "Red on white text." The text is red, as defined by the `ForegroundColor` parameter. The background is white, as defined by the `BackgroundColor` parameter.
    ---------- Example 5: Suppress output from Write-Host ----------
    
    # The following two statements can be used to effectively suppress output from Write-Host
    Write-Host "I won't print" -InformationAction Ignore
    Write-Host "I won't print" 6> $null
    
    These commands effectively suppress output of the `Write-Host` cmdlet. The first one uses the `InformationAction` parameter with the `Ignore` Value to suppress output to the information stream. The second example redirects the information stream of the command to the `$null` variable and thereby suppresses it.
